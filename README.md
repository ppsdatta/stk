# stk

A Clojure library that enables you to code like it is Forth

## Usage

In Forth everything is evaluated on a global Stack. What if we had the same ability in Clojure - not a separate language but within Clojure as a library.

Example:
```[clojure]
[{:double [dup plus]} 1 2 2 plus :double :double mult dup minus .]
```
